title: "Operators"
---

All the numeric types support a basic set of arithmetic operators:

* addition: `+`
* subtraction: `-`
* multiplication: `*`
* division: `/`

`bool` support short-circuiting and non-short-circuiting operators:

* bitwise-and (LHS and RHS are both always evaluated): `&`
* logical-and (RHS is only evaluated if the LHS is true): `&&`

* bitwise-or (LHS and RHS are both always evaluated): `|`
* logical-or (RHS is only evaluated if the LHS is false): `||`

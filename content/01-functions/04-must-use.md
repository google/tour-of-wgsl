A function with a return type may be marked with the `@must_use` attribute, which makes it a
compile time error if there a statement that is *just* a call to that function.

In other words, the value resulting from calling that function must be *used* for some purpose:
* in a larger expression,
* in an assignment or declaration, or
* to manage control flow, etc.

Many of the builtin functions are marked as `@must_use`.

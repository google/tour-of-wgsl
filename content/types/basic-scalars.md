The fundamental WGSL types are:

* `i32` - a signed, two's complement, 32-bit integer.
* `u32` - an unsigned 32-bit integer.
* `f32` - an IEEE-754 binary32, floating point.
* `bool` - a `true` or `false` value, with no specified storage representation.

These types are known as concrete scalar types, and can be used in [all evaluation stages]({{< ref "/expressions" >}}).
